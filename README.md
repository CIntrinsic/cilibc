### Getting Help

- [Back to menu](#menu)

We provide different support channels depending on the issue type:

- For bugs, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CIntrinsic/cilibc/issues) and fill the bug report template.
- For feature discussions, join our [mailing list](#mailing-list) and start your subject line with #DISCUSSION.
- For any other questions or help, send email to [intrinsic.dev.team@gmail.com](mailto:intrinsic.dev.team@gmail.com).
- Security issues should never be reported via issues, see [Security](#security) below.

### Mailing List

- [Back to menu](#menu)

> Coming soon. Stay tuned.

### Installation

- [Back to menu](#menu)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CILibc is under active development and not ready for production or general installation.

Using it on standard systems may cause incompatibilities with existing libc implementations, including unexpected crashes or system failures.

Only use on controlled or experimental environments.

### Autobot

- [Back to menu](#menu)

The autobot is our build, test, and documentation system for CILibc. It automates everything needed to compile, verify, and generate docs.

##### Minimum requirements:

- Python 3
- GCC or another compatible C compiler
- LD or another linker

##### For full development use, you also need:

- Doxygen
- Clang (including clang-format)

Full documentation on the autobot is available at [./docs/autobot/README.md](./docs/autobot/README.md).

##### Basic commands:

```shell
./autobot --help
```

Shows all available options.

##### To compile the libc:

```shell
./autobot --compile
```

##### To run all tests:

```shell
./autobot --test
# or
./autobot --test all
```

##### For specific test options:

```shell
./autobot help-test
```

Displays options to run partial tests.

### Documentation

- [Back to menu](#menu)

We provide multiple layers of documentation tailored to different users:

- **Users:** See [docs/guides/](./docs/guides/README.md) for usage tips, code snippets, installation and configuration guides, tuning advice, and testing instructions.
- **Developers:** Check [docs/dev-docs/](./docs/dev-docs/README.md) for security guidelines, architecture overviews, development practices, implementation details, and references to external documentation (e.g., POSIX headers).
- **Auto-generated docs:** The **auto_docs/** directory is generated by Doxygen and contains detailed API documentation, code structure, and cross-references covering all of CILibc.
- **Build system docs:** [docs/autobot/](./docs/autobot/README.md) holds all information related to our build/test helper bot, commands, usage guides, and troubleshooting.

### Benchmark
